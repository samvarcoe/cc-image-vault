Feature: Collections - Creation and Loading 
    User Story: As a developer, I want to create and load Collection instances, so that I can manage isolated image collections with persistent database connections.

    Acceptance Criteria
      - AC1: Collection class provides constructor for new collections with ID and path parameters
      - AC2: Collection class provides static load method for existing collections
      - AC3: Collection class establishes persistent database connections
      - AC4: Collection class ensures atomic directory and database creation
      - AC5: Collection class throws meaningful errors for creation and loading failures

    # Positive Scenarios

    Scenario: Collection creation with valid parameters
        Given the developer provides a valid collection ID and base path
        When the developer creates a new Collection instance
        Then the collection initializes with the provided ID and path
        And the collection creates the necessary directory structure
        And the collection initializes the SQLite database with proper schema
        And the collection establishes a persistent database connection

    Scenario: Collection loading from existing directory
        Given a collection exists at the specified path with valid database
        When the developer calls Collection.load() with the collection path
        Then the system returns a Collection instance
        And the collection connects to the existing SQLite database with persistent connection
        And the collection validates the directory structure integrity

    # Negative Scenarios

    Scenario: Collection creation with invalid path
        Given the developer provides an invalid or inaccessible base path
        When the developer attempts to create a new Collection instance
        Then the collection throws a meaningful error about invalid path
        And the collection creates no files or directories

    Scenario: Collection creation with insufficient permissions
        Given the developer provides a path with insufficient write permissions
        When the developer attempts to create a new Collection instance
        Then the collection throws a meaningful error about permission denied
        And the collection creates no partial directory structure

    Scenario: Collection creation with database failure
        Given the developer provides a valid path but database initialization fails
        When the developer attempts to create a new Collection instance
        Then the collection throws a meaningful error about database creation failure
        And the collection removes any partially created directories
        And the collection leaves the filesystem in its original state

    Scenario: Collection loading with access issues
        Given a collection directory exists with database or permission problems
        When the developer calls Collection.load() with the collection path
        Then the collection throws a meaningful error about access failure
        And the error message indicates the specific access issue

    # Edge Cases

    Scenario: Collection operations under resource constraints
        Given the system operates under resource constraints
        When the developer performs collection creation or loading operations
        Then the collection manages resources efficiently
        And the collection throws meaningful errors if resources are insufficient
        And operations maintain atomicity despite constraints
```

        And the collection returns the image metadata including the generated ID

    Scenario: Image retrieval with status filter
        Given a Collection instance contains multiple images in different statuses
        When the developer queries images with a status filter
        Then the collection returns only images matching the specified status
        And the collection includes complete image metadata in results
        And the collection orders results by updated_at timestamp

    Scenario: Image retrieval without filter
        Given a Collection instance contains multiple images

    # Positive Scenarios

    Scenario: Image status update with valid transition
        Given a Collection instance contains an image in the current status
        When the developer updates the image status to a new valid status
        Then the collection updates the image record in the database atomically
        And the collection sets the updated_at timestamp
        And the collection commits the database transaction
        And the collection returns the updated image metadata

    Scenario: Image deletion from archive status
        Given a Collection instance contains an image in ARCHIVE status
        When the developer deletes the image
        Then the collection removes the image record from the database
        And the collection deletes the original image file
        And the collection deletes the thumbnail image file
        And the collection commits all changes atomically
        And the collection returns confirmation of deletion

    # Negative Scenarios

        And the database record remains intact

    # Edge Cases

    Scenario: Concurrent image operations
        Given a Collection instance maintains persistent database connection
        When multiple operations attempt to modify the same image simultaneously

## Test Orchestration Notes

### Shared Test Setup Patterns

**Collection Instance States:**
- `Collection instance exists`: Create new collection with temporary test directory and valid database
- `Collection instance contains an image in [STATUS]`: Use test fixture with pre-loaded image in specified status
- `Collection instance contains multiple images`: Use test fixture with images across different statuses for filtering tests

**Failure Simulation:**
- `database initialization fails`: Mock SQLite connection failure during schema creation
- `image processing fails`: Provide corrupted or unsupported file format
- `storage operation fails`: Mock filesystem full or permission denied errors
- `database constraint prevents update`: Attempt invalid status transition or constraint violation

**Resource Constraints:**
- `system resource constraints`: Mock memory/disk usage to simulate pressure
- `database connection issues`: Mock connection timeout or database lock scenarios

### Acceptance Test Mapping

Each scenario maps to specific test implementations:
- **Given clauses** → Test fixture setup and state preparation
- **When clauses** → Direct Collection class method calls
- **Then clauses** → Assertions on return values, file system state, and database state
- **Error scenarios** → Exception type and message validation

The modular structure allows tests to be run independently while sharing common setup utilities for consistent state orchestration.

## Notes
The Collection class serves as the core data access layer for the image vault application. It encapsulates all SQLite database operations and file system interactions for a single collection, ensuring data consistency and proper error handling.

Key implementation considerations:
- Each collection is completely isolated with its own SQLite database
- Image processing (thumbnails, hashing) happens synchronously during add operations
- File naming uses UUIDs to prevent conflicts while preserving original names in metadata
- Status transitions follow the defined workflow: INBOX → COLLECTION → ARCHIVE → DELETE
- Error messages should be descriptive enough for debugging but user-friendly for API responses

The separated feature files enable focused testing while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all Collection class responsibilities.

The class design supports the existing API structure defined in the PRD and enables clean separation between business logic and data persistence.
