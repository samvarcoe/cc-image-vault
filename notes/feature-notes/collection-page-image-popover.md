# Feature Notes - Collection Page Image Popover

## Summary
Enables users to click on image thumbnails in the collection page to view them at full size in a centered popover, providing detailed image examination without leaving the collection context.

## Executable Specification
**Requirement File:** `requirements/ui/collection-page-image-popover.feature`
**Acceptance Test File:** `tests/ui/specs/collection-page-image-popover.spec.ts`

**Scenarios**
- User opens popover by clicking thumbnail
- Popover displays full-size image when it fits viewport
- Popover scales down large image to fit viewport
- User closes popover by clicking outside image
- User closes popover with ESC key

**Testing Notes**
The test implementation uses a specialized fixture system for testing image scaling behaviors at different viewport sizes. Key testing components include:

- **PopoverFixtures**: Creates collections with images specifically sized relative to 1920x1080 viewport
  - Small images (800x600, 600x800) that fit within viewport with 5% margin
  - Large images (2400x1600, 1200x1800) that exceed viewport effective area
  - Both landscape and portrait orientations for comprehensive scaling tests

- **ImagePopoverComponent**: UI Model component encapsulating popover interactions
  - Full-size image display verification (non-thumbnail URLs)
  - Native vs scaled sizing assertions with aspect ratio preservation
  - Background blur/overlay effect detection via CSS classes
  - Thumbnail disable/enable state management
  - Viewport centering calculations with 5px tolerance

- **Collection Page Enhancements**: Extended existing CollectionPage model
  - Added popover interaction methods (clickImageThumbnail, shouldHavePopoverOpen/Closed)
  - Integrated with existing image grid functionality
  - Maintains consistency with current UI Model patterns

- **Viewport Configuration**: Explicit 1920x1080 viewport in playwright.config.ts
  - Effective area calculations: 1824x1026 (with 5% margin)
  - Predictable sizing behavior for automated scaling tests

- **Visual State Assertions**: CSS class-based blur detection for fast execution
  - Background effects verification without visual snapshots
  - Thumbnail interaction state checking via DOM properties
  - Popover positioning validation using getBoundingClientRect

The test suite uses proper TDD approach - tests are implemented first and will guide the implementation. All fixtures clean up automatically and tests run in parallel-safe manner.

## Interfaces
```typescript
// Extension to existing CollectionPageModel for popover state
interface CollectionPageModel {
  // Existing properties...
  
  // New popover-specific state
  isPopoverOpen(): boolean;
  getPopoverImageId(): string | null;
  openPopover(imageId: string): void;
  closePopover(): void;
}

// Extension to existing CollectionPageView for popover rendering
interface CollectionPageView {
  // Existing methods...
  
  // New popover rendering methods
  renderPopover(): string;
  renderPopoverBackdrop(): string;
}

// Extension to existing CollectionPageController for popover interactions
interface CollectionPageController {
  // Existing methods...
  
  // New popover event handlers
  handleThumbnailClick(imageId: string): void;
  handlePopoverClose(): void;
  handleEscKeyPress(event: KeyboardEvent): void;
  handleBackdropClick(): void;
}
```

## Implementation Summary

Collection page image popover feature successfully implemented enabling users to click thumbnails to view full-size images in centered popovers with proper scaling, blur effects, and keyboard/click interactions for closing.

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Clean separation with model state management, view rendering, and controller event handling
- **Event Delegation**: Uses data-action attributes for clean event handling without direct DOM manipulation
- **CSS-First Approach**: Leverages CSS transforms, flexbox, and viewport units for proper centering and scaling
- **Test Integration**: Updated test structure to support backdrop as sibling element for better positioning control

### Key Implementation Details
- **Viewport Scaling**: Images scale within 90vw/90vh (5% margin) while preserving aspect ratio
- **Z-Index Layering**: Backdrop (999) â†’ Popover (1000) for proper click handling
- **Pointer Events**: Strategic use of `pointer-events: none` on both popover container and image to allow backdrop clicks through
- **Click-Through Architecture**: Popover container allows events to pass through while maintaining visual layering
- **State Synchronization**: View re-renders triggered by controller actions for consistent UI state
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: ESC key handler with proper event prevention

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Thumbnails use native lazy loading for optimal performance
- **Event Efficiency**: Single document-level event listeners with delegation vs multiple per-thumbnail handlers
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth popover transitions
- **No Memory Leaks**: Clean event listener management and proper cleanup on model state changes

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern CSS (flexbox, viewport units, transforms) supported in all target browsers
- Leverages native lazy loading with progressive enhancement
- Proper fallback handling for keyboard events across browsers

## Issue Resolution

### Backdrop Click Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Tests were hanging when attempting to close popover by clicking outside the image. The popover container was intercepting click events before they could reach the backdrop element.

**Root Cause**: The `.image-popover` container had a higher z-index (1000) than the backdrop (999) and was positioned over it, blocking click events from reaching the backdrop that had the `data-action="close-popover"` attribute.

**Solution**: Added `pointer-events: none` to the `.image-popover` container CSS rule. This allows click events to pass through the popover container to the backdrop underneath while maintaining proper visual layering.

**Files Changed**: 
- `public/css/collection.css` - Added `pointer-events: none` to `.image-popover` selector

**Test Results**: All 5 popover scenarios now pass, including both click-outside and ESC key closing functionality.
