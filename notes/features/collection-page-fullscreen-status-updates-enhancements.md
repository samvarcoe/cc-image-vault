# Feature Notes - Fullscreen Status Updates Enhancements

## Summary
Enhancement to the existing fullscreen status updates feature that adds two edge case scenarios to improve user experience when exiting fullscreen mode and handling the last image in a filtered view.

## Context
This is an **enhancement** to the original fullscreen status updates feature. The base implementation is already complete and documented in `collection-page-fullscreen-status-updates.md`. These enhancements add two specific edge cases identified during user testing.

### Original Feature Coverage
The base feature already implements:
- Keyboard shortcuts for status updates (Tab for Keep/Restore, Backspace for Discard)
- Success/error messaging with proper timing
- Automatic image advancement after updates
- Context-specific constraints (status-based keyboard shortcuts)

### Enhancement Scope
This enhancement specifically addresses:
1. **Grid synchronization** when exiting fullscreen after updates
2. **Auto-close behavior** when updating the last image of a filtered view

## Executable Specification
Requirement File: `client/requirements/collection-page/fullscreen-status-updates.feature`
Acceptance Test File: `client/tests/acceptance/specs/collection-page/fullscreen-status-updates.spec.ts`

**Enhancement Scenarios**
- User exits fullscreen mode after updating images
- User updates the last image

## Implementation Summary
Enhanced the existing fullscreen status update functionality to handle two edge cases that improve user experience by ensuring proper grid synchronization and automatic closure when appropriate.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes

**Controller Enhancement (`client/src/pages/collection/controller.ts:597-602`)**
- Modified status update flow to remove updated images from filtered view immediately after successful API call
- Uses existing `removeImages()` method followed by `advancePopoverToNext()` for clean separation of concerns
- Maintains 500ms timing for user feedback before image advancement

**Model Enhancement (`client/src/pages/collection/model.ts:168-204`)**
- Enhanced `advancePopoverToNext()` method to handle empty filtered views gracefully
- Added auto-close logic when no images remain in current status filter
- Added fallback logic for missing current image (shows first available image)

### Key Implementation Details
- **Clean Architecture**: Reused existing methods rather than creating duplicates
- **Minimal Changes**: Enhanced existing functionality without breaking changes
- **Proper State Management**: Removes updated images from filtered view to maintain consistency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles edge cases like empty views and missing images

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Grid Synchronization**: When user exits fullscreen after updates, grid correctly reflects status changes
2. **Auto-Close**: When updating the last image in a status filter, popover automatically closes showing empty state
3. **Missing Images**: If current image no longer exists in filter, shows first available image
4. **Empty Views**: If no images remain in filter, closes popover and shows appropriate empty state message

## Technical Notes
- Implementation leverages existing `removeImages()` functionality to maintain model consistency
- Auto-close behavior is triggered by enhanced `advancePopoverToNext()` when image array is empty
- Tests were improved to capture actual displayed image IDs rather than assume ordering for better robustness
- Feature maintains backward compatibility with existing fullscreen status update behavior
