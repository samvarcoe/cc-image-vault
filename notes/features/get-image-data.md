# Feature Notes - Get Image Data

## Summary
Domain feature to retrieve original image file data as Buffer from Collections using image ID, with comprehensive validation and error handling.

## Executable Specification
Requirement File: `domain/requirements/images/get-image-data.feature`
Acceptance Test File: `domain/tests/acceptance/specs/images/get-image-data.spec.ts`

**Scenarios**
- User retrieves image data using a valid ID
- User attempts to retrieve image data for a non-existent image
- User attempts to retrieve image data using an invalid ID
- An internal error occurs when retrieving image data

**Testing Notes**
Tests follow the established domain testing patterns using Mocha with the custom AssertableError utility for comprehensive error validation. Key implementation details:

- Uses existing `getImageFixture()` utility for test data setup
- Validates Buffer return type and non-zero length for successful retrieval
- Tests comprehensive error chain validation with `ImageRetrievalError` wrapping specific causes
- Uses Sinon mocking for internal error simulation via database stub
- Follows 1:1 mapping between Gherkin scenarios and test cases
- Leverages existing error types: `ImageRetrievalError`, `ImageNotFoundError`
- Tests validate ID sanitization with unsafe characters (e.g., `<>`)
- All tests currently fail with `PendingImplementationError` as expected, confirming the `Collection.getImageData()` method requires implementation
