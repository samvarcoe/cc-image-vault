# Feature Notes - Fullscreen Popover Navigation Enhancement

## Summary
Added slideshow-like navigation capabilities to the existing fullscreen popover functionality. Users can now advance through images using keyboard (ENTER key) and mouse wheel interactions while viewing images in the popover.

## Changes Made

### New Scenarios Added
Three new scenarios have been added to the feature specification:

1. **User advances image with keyboard** - ENTER key advances to next image
2. **User advances image with mouse** - Mouse wheel down advances to next image
3. **User goes back to previous image with mouse** - Mouse wheel up goes to previous image

### Files Modified

#### 1. `client/requirements/collection-page/fullscreen-popover.feature`
- Added 3 new Gherkin scenarios for popover navigation
- Scenarios follow existing pattern with Given/When/Then structure
- Integration with existing popover functionality

#### 2. `client/tests/acceptance/specs/collection-page/fullscreen-popover.spec.ts`
- Added 3 new Playwright test implementations
- Tests validate image navigation behavior by checking src attributes
- Each test opens popover, triggers navigation, and verifies correct image is displayed

#### 3. `client/tests/ui-model/pages/collection.ts`
Enhanced the `Popover` class with new methods:
- `shouldShowImage(imageId, collectionName)`: Validates popover displays expected image
- `scrollDown()`: Simulates mouse wheel down for advancing to next image
- `scrollUp()`: Simulates mouse wheel up for going to previous image

## Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED - All Features Implemented and Tested

**Test Results**: All 3 new navigation tests **PASS** ✅
- ✅ User advances image with keyboard (ENTER key)
- ✅ User advances image with mouse (mouse wheel down)
- ✅ User goes back to previous image with mouse (mouse wheel up)

**Quality Assurance**:
- ✅ All 10 popover tests pass (10/10) - no regressions
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Full test coverage maintained

### Implementation Completed

#### 4. `client/src/pages/collection/model.ts` ✅ **NEW**
Enhanced `CollectionPageModel` with navigation methods:
- `advancePopoverToNext()`: Advances to next image with wraparound logic
- `advancePopoverToPrevious()`: Goes to previous image with wraparound logic
- Automatic error clearing when navigating to new images
- Navigation within current filtered collection (respects status filters)

#### 5. `client/src/pages/collection/controller.ts` ✅ **NEW**
Enhanced `CollectionPageController` with event handling:
- **ENTER Key**: Extended existing keyboard handler for popover navigation
- **Mouse Wheel**: Added new wheel event listener with:
  - Wheel down (deltaY > 0) = advance to next image
  - Wheel up (deltaY < 0) = go to previous image
  - Event scoped to popover element only
  - Prevents default scrolling behavior

### Technical Implementation Details
- **MVC Architecture**: Followed existing patterns - no DOM manipulation in model
- **State Management**: Reused existing popover state and error handling
- **Navigation Logic**: Sequence based on current collection images array order
- **Edge Cases**: Implemented wraparound behavior (first ↔ last image)
- **Event Handling**: Non-passive wheel listener to enable preventDefault()
- **Accessibility**: Maintained existing focus management and keyboard navigation

## Interfaces
```ts
// CollectionPageModel - Added navigation methods
class CollectionPageModel extends Model<CollectionPageData> {
    // Navigate to next image in collection sequence (with wraparound)
    advancePopoverToNext(): void;

    // Navigate to previous image in collection sequence (with wraparound)
    advancePopoverToPrevious(): void;
}

// No new public interfaces - leverages existing popover state management
```

## Implementation Summary
Enhanced the existing fullscreen popover with slideshow-like navigation capabilities. Users can now browse through images using ENTER key or mouse wheel without closing the popover. Navigation follows the collection order with wraparound behavior, respects current status filters, and maintains all existing popover functionality including error handling and accessibility features.

## Technical Notes
- Navigation sequence determined by current `images` array order (affected by status filters)
- Wraparound behavior: next from last image goes to first, previous from first goes to last
- Mouse wheel events use non-passive listener to enable preventDefault() and stop page scrolling
- All navigation clears previous popover errors automatically
- Implementation follows TDD approach - tests were written first and implementation made them pass
- Zero regressions - all existing popover functionality preserved and tested

## Testing Notes
- Tests use existing `createCollectionFixture` for consistent test data
- Navigation tests require at least 2 images in collection to validate sequence
- Tests follow TDD approach - implementation should make these tests pass
- All existing popover functionality remains intact and tested
