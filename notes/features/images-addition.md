# Feature Notes - Images Addition

## Summary
Implements image addition functionality for Collections, enabling users to add various image formats (jpg/jpeg/png/webp) with comprehensive validation, processing, and error handling.

## Executable Specification
**Requirement File:** `domain/requirements/images/addition.feature`  
**Acceptance Test File:** `domain/tests/acceptance/specs/images/addition.spec.ts`

**Scenarios:**
1. User adds a jpg image to a Collection
2. User adds a jpg image with "jpeg" extension to a Collection
3. User adds a png image to a Collection
4. User adds a webp image to a Collection
5. User attempts to add an image to a Collection using a path that does not exist
6. User attempts to add a duplicate image to Collection
7. User attempts to add an image with unsupported format
8. User attempts to add a corrupted image file
9. User attempts to add an image with unsafe filename
10. User attempts to add an image with filename that exceeds 256 characters
11. An internal error occurs when adding an image to a Collection

## Testing Notes

### Test Implementation
- **Error Handling Pattern**: Uses new async error validation util
- **Image Fixtures**: Leverages existing image fixture system with new corrupted/invalid image fixtures
- **Validation Utilities**: Created `ImageUtils` class for comprehensive image validation including metadata assertions and file existence checks
- **File System Verification**: Tests verify proper image and thumbnail creation in expected directories

### Key Utilities Added
- **`ImageUtils`**: Domain-specific assertions for image metadata, file existence, and status validation
- **Extended Image Fixtures**: Added corrupted image, unsupported file, unsafe filename, and long filename fixtures  
- **`ImageAdditionError`**: New error class following existing domain error patterns with cause chaining

### Test Infrastructure
- **Setup/Teardown**: Uses existing `CollectionUtils` for collection lifecycle management
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests designed to run in parallel using unique collection names
- **Assertion Strategy**: Follows STATE methodology from testing guidance with business-focused error messages
- **Mock Strategy**: Minimal mocking - only mocks filesystem operations for internal error simulation

### Implementation Requirements
- **File Format Support**: jpg, jpeg (normalized to jpg), png, webp
- **Validation Chain**: Format → Integrity → Filename safety → Duplicate detection → Processing
- **File Operations**: Atomic operations with cleanup on failure
- **Metadata Storage**: Full image metadata with SHA256 hash for duplicate detection
- **Default Status**: All images added with "INBOX" status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error wrapping with specific cause information

## Implementation Completed ✅

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented image addition functionality following TDD methodology. The `Collection.addImage()` method now provides comprehensive image processing with robust validation, error handling, and file management.

### Core Implementation (`domain/src/collection.ts`)
- **Validation Pipeline**: Implemented multi-stage validation (format → filename → file existence → integrity → duplicates)
- **File Processing**: Atomic file operations with Sharp-based thumbnail generation (400px width, aspect-preserved)
- **Database Integration**: SQLite metadata storage with proper transaction handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error wrapping using `ImageAdditionError` with cause chaining
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Automatic cleanup of partial files on failure

### Key Technical Details
- **Format Normalization**: `.jpeg` files automatically normalized to `.jpg` extension
- **Hash-based Deduplication**: SHA256 file hash prevents duplicate images in collections
- **Directory Structure**: Creates files in `images/original/` and `images/thumbnails/` directories
- **Mockable Operations**: Uses `fsOps` interface for filesystem operations to enable test mocking
- **Metadata Fields**: Stores complete image metadata (dimensions, aspect ratio, size, hash, timestamps)

### Validation Features Implemented
- **File Format**: Supports jpg/jpeg/png/webp with strict extension validation
- **File Integrity**: Sharp-based image validation detects corrupted files
- **Filename Safety**: Prevents XSS-style attacks (javascript:, <script>, iframe, etc.)
- **Filename Length**: Enforces 256-character filename limit
- **Duplicate Detection**: SHA256-based duplicate prevention per collection
- **File Existence**: Validates source file exists and is accessible

### Test Results
- **All 11 scenarios passing**: Complete test coverage for success and error cases
- **No regressions**: All existing Collection tests continue to pass (27 total domain tests)
- **Clean build**: No TypeScript or lint errors

### Technical Notes
- Fixed test infrastructure bug where `ImageUtils.assertImageFileExists()` was incorrectly checking for directories instead of files
- Resolved path consistency issues between test utilities and implementation
- Implementation follows existing codebase patterns and error handling strategies
- Uses Sharp library for high-performance image processing and metadata extraction
