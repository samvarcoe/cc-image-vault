# Feature Notes - Images Addition

## Summary
Implements image addition functionality for Collections, enabling users to add various image formats (jpg/jpeg/png/webp) with comprehensive validation, processing, and error handling.

## Executable Specification
**Requirement File:** `domain/requirements/images/addition.feature`  
**Acceptance Test File:** `domain/tests/acceptance/specs/images/addition.spec.ts`

**Scenarios:**
1. User adds a jpg image to a Collection
2. User adds a jpg image with "jpeg" extension to a Collection
3. User adds a png image to a Collection
4. User adds a webp image to a Collection
5. User attempts to add an image to a Collection using a path that does not exist
6. User attempts to add a duplicate image to Collection
7. User attempts to add an image with unsupported format
8. User attempts to add a corrupted image file
9. User attempts to add an image with unsafe filename
10. User attempts to add an image with filename that exceeds 256 characters
11. An internal error occurs when adding an image to a Collection

## Testing Notes

### Test Implementation
- **Error Handling Pattern**: Uses new async error validation util
- **Image Fixtures**: Leverages existing image fixture system with new corrupted/invalid image fixtures
- **Validation Utilities**: Created `ImageUtils` class for comprehensive image validation including metadata assertions and file existence checks
- **File System Verification**: Tests verify proper image and thumbnail creation in expected directories

### Key Utilities Added
- **`ImageUtils`**: Domain-specific assertions for image metadata, file existence, and status validation
- **Extended Image Fixtures**: Added corrupted image, unsupported file, unsafe filename, and long filename fixtures  
- **`ImageAdditionError`**: New error class following existing domain error patterns with cause chaining

### Test Infrastructure
- **Setup/Teardown**: Uses existing `CollectionUtils` for collection lifecycle management
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests designed to run in parallel using unique collection names
- **Assertion Strategy**: Follows STATE methodology from testing guidance with business-focused error messages
- **Mock Strategy**: Minimal mocking - only mocks filesystem operations for internal error simulation

### Implementation Requirements
- **File Format Support**: jpg, jpeg (normalized to jpg), png, webp
- **Validation Chain**: Format → Integrity → Filename safety → Duplicate detection → Processing
- **File Operations**: Atomic operations with cleanup on failure
- **Metadata Storage**: Full image metadata with SHA256 hash for duplicate detection
- **Default Status**: All images added with "INBOX" status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error wrapping with specific cause information

### Ready for Implementation
All tests fail with `PendingImplementationError` as expected, indicating the specification is ready for TDD implementation of the `Collection.addImage()` method.
